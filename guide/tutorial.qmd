This tutorial walks you through creating compelling cybersecurity case studies using the **Cyber Dimensions methodology**—a research-based approach that helps your students engage with the complex, collaborative realities of cybersecurity work. Rather than simply presenting technical concepts, this method helps you create realistic scenarios where your students experience how cybersecurity teams actually coordinate across technology, people, and organizations.

This methodology was developed and refined through Design-Based Research at the University of Arizona, including implementation in the published "Cyber Dimensions" textbook [@straightHumanCentricModelsCybersecurity2024] and systematic analysis of the NICE Workforce Framework [@straightCyberDimensionsImmersive2025]. Classroom implementation revealed that your students engaging with these interconnected scenarios will develop enhanced capabilities for understanding cybersecurity as collaborative, distributed work rather than individual technical problem-solving.

## Student Learning Evidence {#sec-classroom-evidence}

Implementation of this methodology across multiple cybersecurity education contexts revealed consistent patterns in student learning that align with industry workforce needs. Analysis of the NICE Workforce Framework using systematic coding techniques identified 47 task statements that explicitly require coordination with rather than control over technological systems, supporting this pedagogical emphasis on collaborative practice you'll be implementing. This, however, is the exception to the rule.

Through this tutorial, you'll learn to create case studies that develop essential cybersecurity capabilities. Your students engaging with these scenarios will develop **systems thinking**—the ability to recognize how cybersecurity incidents involve complex interactions between technology, people, and organizational processes rather than isolated technical problems. They'll also strengthen **collaborative problem-solving** skills through working effectively with diverse stakeholders including technical teams, management, legal departments, and communications staff during security incidents.

The methodology particularly emphasizes **technology integration**, helping your students develop practical skills for coordinating human analysis with automated tools and systems rather than treating technology as separate from human work. Your students will also enhance their **communication across contexts**, learning to translate technical findings for different audiences and coordinate response efforts across organizational boundaries. Finally, the approach develops **ethical reasoning** capabilities, helping your students understand how cybersecurity decisions affect multiple stakeholders and require consideration of competing values and constraints.

Classroom observation during "Cyber Dimensions" textbook implementation showed that your students engaging with interconnected scenarios will consistently demonstrate enhanced comfort with complexity and ambiguity—essential capabilities for cybersecurity professionals working in constantly evolving threat environments.

## Core Principles {#sec-core-principles}

This methodology recognizes that cybersecurity work is inherently collaborative and distributed across people, technology, and organizational systems. Rather than teaching cybersecurity as individual technical skills, you can use effective case studies to help your students experience the coordination challenges that characterize real cybersecurity practice.

The approach builds on research establishing that cybersecurity effectiveness emerges through networks connecting human expertise, technological capabilities, and organizational processes. This understanding shapes every aspect of case study design:

The methodology operates on several interconnected principles that distinguish it from traditional case study approaches. **Realistic complexity** ensures scenarios preserve the ambiguity and multiple stakeholder perspectives that characterize actual cybersecurity incidents, rather than simplifying problems into neat academic exercises. This complexity supports **collaborative problem-solving** where students work with others and coordinate with technological tools rather than solving problems in isolation.

Each case study you create should maintain a **systems perspective**, demonstrating how cybersecurity decisions ripple across technical, organizational, and social domains. Your approach should deliberately incorporate **multiple stakeholder views**, including perspectives from technical analysts, management, legal teams, communications staff, and affected communities. Finally, **technology integration** helps your students learn to work WITH automated tools and systems as partners rather than treating technology as separate from human analysis.

This framework extends postphenomenological analysis in cybersecurity education by integrating insights about human-technology relations with practical case study development. The synthesis addresses the gap between theoretical sophistication and pedagogical utility identified in cybersecurity education literature.

## Phase 1: Getting Started {#sec-getting-started}

When you develop effective case studies, you need systematic organization that keeps track of interconnected story elements, characters, and technical details. The "Cyber Dimensions" textbook development revealed that consistent project organization is essential for maintaining realistic story continuity across multiple scenarios.

The "Cyber Dimensions" textbook uses a **centralized worldbuilding system** that manages all fictional data through a structured YAML file and automated processing. This approach ensures consistency across multiple interconnected case studies you create while making updates efficient and reliable.

## Centralized Worldbuilding {#sec-centralized-worldbuilding}

Rather than managing character and organizational information in separate folders, you can use this methodology's single master data file that feeds all your case studies:

**Core Architecture**:

- **`_worldbuilding.yml`** - Master data file containing 933+ variables for characters, organizations, technologies, and relationships
- **`_scripts/setup.R`** - Pre-render script that converts YAML data into a cached R data object  
- **`_world_data.rds`** - Binary cache file for fast loading during document rendering
- **`_scripts/solo_render.R`** - Script sourced by individual case studies to access the `world` object

This system ensures that when a character appears in multiple cases you create, their details remain consistent. For example, Katherine Pillar appears as CEO of TechGiant in one case while her sister Eleanor Pillar appears as CEO of Quantum Frontier in another case—the family relationship is maintained automatically through your centralized data.

### Using World Data {#sec-using-world-data}

Each case study file you create includes a setup chunk that loads the centralized world data, then references variables throughout the narrative using inline R code. This approach makes updating character names, company details, or relationships efficient across all your cases.

**Example Implementation**:

````{verbatim}
```r
# At the top of each case study QMD file
source(here::here("_scripts", "solo_render.R"))
```
````

**Using Variables in Content**:

````{verbatim}
Founded in 2005, `r world$company_name` 
has rapidly become a leader in the social media and technology industry. 
The company's mission is to create innovative digital solutions that 
enhance human connection and self-expression in the online world.

**Key facts about** `r world$company_name`:

- Founded: 2005
- Headquarters: Palo Alto, California  
- CEO: `r world$ceo_name_salutation` `r world$ceo_name_first` `r world$ceo_name_last`
- Annual Revenue: $78 billion (2023)

````

This systematic approach means that changing a character's name or role in your `_worldbuilding.yml` file automatically updates it across all case studies that reference that character. The approach emerged from classroom observation showing that your students will engage more deeply with scenarios when they recognize familiar characters and organizations from previous cases, creating a sense of inhabiting a coherent professional world.

### Quarto Configuration {#sec-quarto-configuration}

Your project requires specific Quarto configuration to enable the centralized worldbuilding system. The pre-render script ensures world data is processed before your individual case studies are rendered.

**Essential `_quarto.yml` Settings**:

```yml
project:
  type: default
  pre-render: _scripts/setup.R  # Processes _worldbuilding.yml before rendering
  render:
    - "**/*.qmd"
    - "!**/*.md"  # Exclude markdown files to avoid duplicates

format:
  html:
    theme: bootstrap
    css: assets/styles.css
    toc: true
    toc-depth: 2
    number-sections: false
    code-fold: false  # Show R code chunks for educational purposes if desired
    
execute:
  freeze: auto  # Cache R code execution for performance
  echo: false   # Hide R code in output by default
  message: false
  warning: false
```

**Key Configuration Elements**:

- **`pre-render: _scripts/setup.R`** - Essential for processing the YAML world data before any QMD files are rendered
- **R execution settings** - Configured to hide technical details while showing educational content
- **Styling** - Consistent visual presentation across all case studies

## Phase 2: Worldbuilding Data {#sec-worldbuilding-data}

### Setting Up _worldbuilding.yml {#sec-worldbuilding-yml-setup}

Your centralized worldbuilding system starts with a structured YAML file containing all the fictional data for your case studies. This file defines characters, organizations, technologies, and their relationships across multiple scenarios. (The following describes a simple single-case project.)

**Creating `_worldbuilding.yml`**:

```yml
# _worldbuilding.yml - Master data file for case studies
world:
  # Global Settings
  this_year: 2025  # Base year for timeline calculations
  textbook_title: "Your Case Study Collection Title"
  
  # Cross-Case Organizations (appear in multiple scenarios)
  technewstoday_name: "TechNewsToday" 
  technewstoday_handle: "\@TechNewsToday"
  
  # Cybersecurity Incident Case Study
  cyberincident_company_name: "SecureCorpInc"
  cyberincident_company_shortname: "SCI"
  cyberincident_ciso_fullname: "Dr. Maria Rodriguez"
  cyberincident_ciso_lastname: "Rodriguez"
  cyberincident_security_analyst_fullname: "Alex Chen"
  cyberincident_security_analyst_lastname: "Chen"
  cyberincident_threat_name: "Operation Shadow Walker"
  
  # External Organizations
  consultant_firm_name: "CyberGuard Solutions"
  consultant_lead_name_first: "Sarah" # CROSS-CASE: Could appear in other scenarios
  consultant_lead_name_last: "Kim"
  consultant_lead_name_salutation: "Ms."
  
  # News Organizations (appear across cases for realistic media coverage)
  news_outlet1_name: "CyberToday"
  news_outlet1_reporter_fullname: "Jennifer Walsh"
  news_outlet1_reporter_lastname: "Walsh"
```

**Key YAML Structure Principles**:

- **Consistent mutli-case naming patterns** - Use prefixes like `casename_` to group related variables
- **Full and last names** - Separate variables allow flexible referencing in different contexts
- **Cross-case annotations** - Comments like `# CROSS-CASE:` track character relationships across scenarios
- **Hierarchical organization** - Group related characters and organizations together

## Phase 3: Processing Scripts {#sec-processing-scripts}

Your worldbuilding system requires two R scripts to process and load the YAML data into your case studies. While the following may seem overly technical, it is set-it-and-forget-it. Using the project format described in this toolkit, you won't need to make any edits.

When you render individual files for testing, you'll need a pre-render script so they can access the `world$` parameter values. Create `_scripts/setup.R` to process your `_worldbuilding.yml` data:

```r
# _scripts/setup.R - Pre-render script to process worldbuilding data

library(yaml)
library(here)

message("Processing worldbuilding data...")

yaml_file <- here::here("_worldbuilding.yml")
rds_file <- here::here("_world_data.rds")

# Check if processing is needed (performance optimization)
process_yaml <- TRUE
if (file.exists(rds_file) && file.exists(yaml_file)) {
  if (file.mtime(yaml_file) <= file.mtime(rds_file)) {
    message("World data is up-to-date. Skipping processing.")
    process_yaml <- FALSE
  }
}

if (process_yaml) {
  # Load YAML data
  if (file.exists(yaml_file)) {
    world_data <- yaml::read_yaml(yaml_file)
    world <- world_data$world
    
    # Save processed data for fast loading
    saveRDS(world, rds_file)
    message("World data processed and cached successfully!")
  } else {
    stop("_worldbuilding.yml not found. Cannot process world data.")
  }
}
```

### Data Loader Script {#sec-data-loader-script}

Create `_scripts/solo_render.R` for your individual QMD files to load the world data. This is a simple quality of life improvement, negating the need to render the entire project to check individual file changes.

```r
# _scripts/solo_render.R - Loads world data for individual QMD files

rds_file <- here::here("_world_data.rds")

if (file.exists(rds_file)) {
  world <- readRDS(rds_file)
  # message("World data loaded successfully for QMD rendering")
} else {
  stop("_world_data.rds not found. Run pre-render script first.")
}
```

Now your case study QMD files can access all the centralized world data through the `world` object, ensuring consistency across multiple scenarios while making updates manageable through your single YAML file.

### Loading World Data {#sec-loading-world-data}

Each case study file you create needs to load the centralized world data to access shared variables. This approach ensures all your cases use consistent character names, organizations, and details while keeping the code simple and maintainable. Every case study QMD file you create should start with this setup:

````{verbatim}
```r
# Load centralized world data system
source(here::here("_scripts", "solo_render.R"))

# The 'world' object now contains all variables from _worldbuilding.yml
# You can access any variable using world$variable_name syntax
# For example:
# - world$junior_analyst_name_first (role-based naming)
# - world$company_name  
# - world$incident_date
# - world$ceo_name_salutation
```
````

This approach provides several key benefits for your cybersecurity case study development:

- **Consistency**: All your cases use the same character and organization data
- **Maintainability**: Updates to character details only need to happen in one place
- **Cross-case continuity**: Characters can appear across multiple scenarios you create with consistent backgrounds
- **Performance**: RDS caching makes loading fast even with large worldbuilding files

## Phase 4: Case Study Content {#sec-case-content-development}

Once you establish your centralized worldbuilding system, you can create case study content that dynamically references shared data. This approach ensures consistency across all your cases while allowing for rich, interconnected narratives that feel authentic and professionally realistic.

For example, you can create `cases/organizational-breach/breach-scenario.qmd`:

````{verbatim}
On `r world$incident_date`, 
`r world$company_name` experienced a significant data breach that 
affected approximately `r world$records_compromised` 
customer accounts. This case study examines the incident from multiple 
professional perspectives, highlighting the complex interplay of technical 
systems, organizational processes, and human decision-making in cybersecurity.

::: {.learner-experience title="Learning Outcomes"}

## Phase 7: Quality Assurance {#sec-quality-assurance}

### Rendering & Testing {#sec-rendering-testing}

When you render your documents, this creates functional educational materials from your source files and centralized data. This process transforms your QMD files and YAML data into polished, professional case studies ready for your classroom use.

```bash
# Render individual case study files
quarto render cases/organizational-breach/breach-scenario.qmd
quarto render cases/organizational-breach/breach-assessment.qmd

# Render entire project for comprehensive testing
quarto render
```

### Verification Checklist {#sec-quality-verification}

You should verify your case study quality through **comprehensive quality indicators** that ensure educational effectiveness:

- [ ] **Data integration**: All your centralized world variables properly load and display across documents
- [ ] **Content consistency**: Character names, organizations, and details remain consistent throughout your cases
- [ ] **Professional accuracy**: Your technical content accurately reflects current cybersecurity industry practices
- [ ] **Educational alignment**: Your assessment questions support stated learning objectives and competency development
- [ ] **Technical functionality**: All cross-references, links, and formatting render correctly across output formats

## Technical Support {#sec-technical-support}

**World data not loading**:

- Verify your `_scripts/setup.R` executed successfully with appropriate processing messages
- Confirm your `_world_data.rds` exists and contains expected world variables
- Validate YAML syntax in your `_worldbuilding.yml` maintains proper structure and indentation

**Case study rendering failures**:

- Check for missing R packages that support your world data processing (yaml, here)
- Ensure your file paths use `here::here()` function for cross-platform compatibility
- Verify your Quarto configuration enables R code execution and variable substitution

**Variable reference issues**:

- Confirm your `solo_render.R` is sourced correctly at the beginning of your QMD files
- Verify your variable names match exactly between YAML file and R expressions (case-sensitive)
- Ensure your R inline code uses proper syntax: `` `r world$variable_name` ``
