# Demonstration Case Study {-}

This toolkit provides comprehensive methodology and templates for creating immersive cybersecurity case studies. To see the Cyber Dimensions approach in action, a complete (though intentionally short) demonstration case study is available that showcases all the principles and techniques described throughout this guide.

## The CIRCUIT Case Study

**CIRCUIT** is a power grid cybersecurity incident that demonstrates the full Cyber Dimensions methodology. This case study features:

- **Immersive fictional world** with realistic organizations, characters, and technical infrastructure
- **Authentic artifacts** including emails, news reports, technical documentation, and social media posts
- **Multiple perspectives** representing different stakeholder viewpoints and ethical positions
- **Realistic complexity** requiring students to navigate competing priorities and incomplete information
- **Flexible assessment** supporting various educational contexts and learning objectives

The case follows cybersecurity professionals as they respond to a sophisticated attack on critical infrastructure, requiring students to analyze technical evidence, evaluate ethical implications, and make time-sensitive decisions under pressure.

## Experience the Complete Case Study

Rather than including excerpts or partial examples in this toolkit, we encourage you to experience the complete rendered case study:

## What You'll Find in the Demo

The CIRCUIT demonstration includes:

- **Complete narrative** with realistic incident timeline and character development
- **Authentic artifact collections** showing how fictional documents create immersive experiences
- **Assessment examples** demonstrating various evaluation approaches
- **Technical implementation** showing Quarto features and styling in practice
- **Student guidance materials** including case briefings and assignment instructions

## Connecting Demo to Methodology

As you explore the CIRCUIT case study, notice how it implements the theoretical principles and practical techniques described throughout this toolkit:

- Posthuman educational approach recognizing distributed agency across human-technology assemblages
- Material-semiotic practices where fictional artifacts shape authentic learning experiences
- Assemblage thinking creating coherent sociotechnical educational networks
- Realistic professional contexts that prepare students for cybersecurity careers

The demonstration serves as both a learning experience and a reference implementation, showing how the Cyber Dimensions methodology creates engaging, educational, and professionally relevant cybersecurity education. Continue through this book to find out how to create your own.
