  abstract = {Simians, Cyborgs and Women is a powerful collection of ten essays written between 1978 and 1989. Although on the surface, simians, cyborgs and women may seem an odd threesome, Haraway describes their profound link as "creatures" which have had a great destabilizing place in Western evolutionary technology and biology. Throughout this book, Haraway analyzes accounts, narratives, and stories of the creation of nature, living organisms, and cyborgs. At once a social reality and a science fiction, the cyborg--a hybrid of organism and machine--represents transgressed boundaries and intense fusions of the nature/culture split. By providing an escape from rigid dualisms, the cyborg exists in a post-gender world, and as such holds immense possibilities for modern feminists. Haraway's recent book, Primate Visions, has been called "outstanding," "original," and "brilliant," by leading scholars in the field. (First published in 1991.)},

  abstract = {This study applies a posthuman lens to the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Workforce Framework, examining two key Work Roles in cybersecurity education. Employing a novel posthuman coding scheme, the associated Tasks, Knowledge, and Skills (TKS) statements were analyzed. Findings reveal significant posthuman elements within the framework while identifying opportunities for further integration. The analysis demonstrates a strong presence of human-technology entanglement and adaptive learning concepts, yet highlights areas where the framework could emphasize system complexity and interconnectedness. This research contributes to ongoing discussions on cybersecurity education in complex technological landscapes, proposing a theoretical framework for integrating posthuman concepts into curricula and laying groundwork for future inquiry.}
