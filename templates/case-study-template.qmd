# Artifact-Based Case Study Development Template

This template guides you through creating immersive, artifact-based cybersecurity case studies that engage students as professionals analyzing authentic documents and evidence. Rather than following linear narratives, students explore realistic collections of emails, logs, news reports, transcripts, and technical documents to understand complex cybersecurity situations and develop response strategies.

## Understanding the Artifact-Based Methodology

**What Makes This Different**: Traditional case studies present information through storytelling. Artifact-based case studies present information through **realistic document collections** that students must analyze, interpret, and synthesize—exactly how cybersecurity professionals work in practice.

**Core Principle**: Students learn by doing what cybersecurity professionals do—analyzing multiple information sources with incomplete data, competing perspectives, and time pressure to make informed decisions about complex sociotechnical situations.

**Educational Foundation**: This methodology embodies posthuman pedagogical principles by recognizing the distributed nature of cybersecurity knowledge across human expertise, technological systems, organizational processes, and regulatory frameworks. Students develop capacity for working **with** rather than **over** these complex assemblages.

## Step 1: Define Your Learning Objectives

Before creating artifacts, establish clear, measurable learning objectives that align with professional cybersecurity practice. Focus on capabilities students need for working effectively within complex human-technology assemblages.

**Professional Competency Framework**

```
After analyzing this artifact collection, students will be able to:

- [Document analysis skill with cybersecurity application]
- [Cross-referencing capability across information sources]
- [Stakeholder perspective recognition through communications]
- [Technical-business integration in decision-making]
- [Collaborative response strategy development]
```

**Example Learning Objectives**

```
After analyzing the Municipal Infrastructure Incident artifacts, students will be able to:

- Correlate SCADA alert patterns with threat actor reconnaissance techniques
- Identify distributed responsibilities across utility operators, vendors, and regulators
- Evaluate human-technology coordination during infrastructure security incidents
- Develop multi-stakeholder response strategies for critical infrastructure protection
```

## Step 2: Choose Your Industry Context and Temporal Setting

Select industry contexts that provide rich artifact diversity and realistic stakeholder networks. Consider sectors where cybersecurity incidents require coordination across multiple organizations, technologies, and regulatory frameworks.

**High-Value Industry Contexts**:

- [ ] **Critical Infrastructure**: SCADA logs, regulatory filings, vendor communications, federal advisories
- [ ] **Healthcare**: Patient data breach notifications, HIPAA compliance documents, medical device alerts
- [ ] **Education**: FERPA privacy incidents, campus network logs, multi-institutional coordination
- [ ] **Financial Services**: Fraud detection systems, regulatory reports, cross-bank information sharing
- [ ] **Government**: Inter-agency coordination, public records, classified document handling procedures

**Temporal Setting Considerations**:

- Set incidents 6-12 months in the past for realism without referencing current events
- Consider regulatory environments and technology landscapes for your chosen timeframe
- Align with technology capabilities students should understand (cloud transitions, AI integration, etc.)

## Step 3: Design Your Organizational Ecosystem

Create realistic networks of organizations that generate authentic document types and communication patterns. Focus on **assemblages** rather than individual organizations—the distributed networks that emerge during cybersecurity incidents.

**Primary Organization Template**:

```
**Organization Name**: [Memorable but professional, avoid real company names]
**Industry Focus**: [Specific sector with realistic scale and complexity]
**Size and Scope**: [Employee count and operational scale that justifies artifact complexity]
**Technology Environment**: [Mix of legacy and modern systems creating realistic vulnerabilities]
**Regulatory Context**: [Compliance requirements that drive documentation and reporting]
**Stakeholder Network**: [Partners, vendors, regulators, customers who participate in responses]
```

**Stakeholder Ecosystem Mapping**:

```
Internal Stakeholders:
- [IT/Security teams - technical analysis and response]
- [Operations teams - business continuity and service delivery]
- [Executive leadership - strategic decision-making and resource allocation]
- [Legal/Compliance - regulatory obligations and disclosure requirements]

External Stakeholders:
- [Technology vendors - system support and forensic assistance]
- [Regulatory agencies - compliance oversight and incident reporting]
- [Industry partners - threat intelligence sharing and coordination]
- [Media/Public - transparency requirements and reputation management]
```

## Step 4: Develop Character Profiles for Document Creation

Create realistic characters who generate authentic communications throughout your incident. Focus on **professional roles** rather than personal details—what matters is how their expertise, responsibilities, and organizational positions shape their communications and decision-making.

**Character Development Framework**:

```
**Name**: [Professional but diverse, reflecting cybersecurity workforce]
**Role**: [Specific title with clear technical/business responsibilities]
**Expertise Level**: [Technical depth appropriate for their position]
**Communication Style**: [How they write emails, present in meetings, document findings]
**Organizational Perspective**: [What they prioritize based on their role and background]
**Network Connections**: [Who they communicate with and coordinate with]
```

**Character Types for Artifact Generation**:

**Technical Specialists**: Generate logs, analysis reports, forensic findings, vendor communications

- Security Analysts (SOC monitoring, incident analysis)
- System Administrators (infrastructure management, access control)
- Network Engineers (traffic analysis, architecture documentation)

**Management and Coordination**: Generate strategic communications, resource decisions, stakeholder management

- IT Managers (team coordination, budget decisions, vendor management)
- Chief Information Security Officers (strategic planning, executive communication)
- Project Managers (timeline coordination, resource allocation)

**Business and Compliance**: Generate regulatory filings, business impact assessments, legal considerations

- Compliance Officers (regulatory requirements, disclosure obligations)
- Business Continuity Managers (operational impact, recovery planning)
- Legal Counsel (liability assessment, regulatory coordination)

## Step 5: Create Your Incident Timeline

Build realistic temporal progression that creates natural document flow and decision pressure. Focus on how different types of artifacts emerge at different stages of incident detection, response, and resolution.

**Artifact-Based Timeline Framework**

```
T-1 Month: [Background documents establishing context - policies, configurations, routine reports]
T-1 Week: [Early warning signs - system alerts, unusual activity reports, vendor notifications]
T-Day 0: [Incident detection - automated alerts, initial human analysis, escalation communications]
T+1 Hour: [Immediate response - emergency communications, containment actions, notification procedures]
T+4 Hours: [Analysis phase - detailed forensics, stakeholder coordination, regulatory notifications]
T+1 Day: [Response coordination - vendor engagement, regulatory filings, media management]
T+1 Week: [Resolution activities - lessons learned reports, policy updates, improvement plans]
```

**Background/Context Phase**:

- Security policies and procedures
- Network architecture diagrams
- Vendor service agreements
- Previous incident reports

**Detection/Initial Response Phase**:

- Automated system alerts and logs
- Initial incident communications
- Emergency response procedures
- Vendor notification calls

**Analysis/Coordination Phase**:

- Detailed technical analysis reports
- Cross-organizational email threads
- Regulatory filing documents
- Media statements and responses

## Step 6: Design Your Central Challenge

Develop complex cybersecurity situations that require students to synthesize information across multiple artifacts, stakeholder perspectives, and technical domains. Focus on **realistic ambiguity** rather than puzzle-solving.

**Challenge Design Principles**:

**Multiple Valid Approaches**: Ensure various response strategies can be justified based on different interpretations of available evidence

**Incomplete Information**: Students must work with gaps, conflicting data, and uncertainty—just like real cybersecurity practice

**Temporal Pressure**: Timeline creates urgency while maintaining realistic decision-making constraints

**Stakeholder Tensions**: Different organizational perspectives create competing priorities that students must navigate

**Technical Complexity**: Sufficient technical depth to require cybersecurity expertise without overwhelming non-specialists

**Distributed Agency**: Solutions require coordination across human expertise, technological systems, and organizational processes
