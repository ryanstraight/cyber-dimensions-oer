# Artifact-Based Assessment Templates

These assessment templates are designed specifically for artifact-based cybersecurity case studies, where students analyze collections of realistic documents rather than following pre-written narratives. The assessments evaluate students' capacity to work with incomplete information, synthesize evidence across multiple sources, and develop professional recommendations based on document analysis—core competencies of cybersecurity practice.

The templates embody posthuman pedagogical principles by recognizing that cybersecurity knowledge emerges through interaction between human expertise, technological systems, organizational processes, and documentary evidence. Students develop professional capabilities by engaging with the same types of information sources, coordination challenges, and decision-making contexts they will encounter in cybersecurity careers.

::: {.methodological-contribution title="Artifact-Based Assessment Innovation"}

These assessment templates represent a methodological shift from knowledge testing to **professional practice simulation**. Rather than evaluating whether students can recall information, these assessments measure their capacity to analyze authentic documents, recognize patterns across information sources, coordinate with colleagues and stakeholders, and develop actionable recommendations under realistic constraints.

The artifact-based approach develops critical professional capabilities that traditional assessments often miss: reading technical logs accurately, interpreting regulatory requirements, recognizing organizational dynamics through communications, and synthesizing complex information under time pressure. Students demonstrate cybersecurity competence by performing the actual analytical work that defines professional practice.

## Assessment Philosophy: Document Analysis and Professional Synthesis

Effective cybersecurity assessment should mirror the information-rich, time-pressured, multi-stakeholder environment of professional practice. Cybersecurity professionals spend much of their time analyzing logs, reading vendor communications, interpreting regulatory requirements, coordinating across organizational boundaries, and synthesizing evidence from multiple sources to make informed recommendations.

**Artifact-Based Assessment** evaluates students' capacity to work effectively with the documentary evidence and communication patterns that characterize real cybersecurity practice. This approach develops capabilities that transfer directly to professional environments while providing rich opportunities for collaborative learning and complex problem-solving.

**Core Assessment Principles**:

**Document Literacy**: Students must demonstrate sophisticated ability to read, interpret, and analyze technical logs, professional communications, regulatory filings, and external reports with attention to both explicit content and implicit organizational dynamics.

**Cross-Referencing Synthesis**: Students develop skills for correlating information across multiple sources, identifying patterns and contradictions, and building comprehensive understanding from fragmented evidence—essential capabilities for cybersecurity investigation and decision-making.

**Stakeholder Perspective Recognition**: Through analyzing different types of documents, students learn to understand how the same events appear different to various organizational roles, technical specializations, and external partners, developing crucial skills for professional communication and coordination.

**Time-Pressured Decision Making**: Assessments simulate the urgency and incomplete information that characterize real cybersecurity incidents, requiring students to make informed recommendations based on available evidence rather than waiting for perfect information.

**Professional Communication**: Students must translate their analysis into clear, actionable recommendations appropriate for different audiences—technical teams, executive leadership, regulatory agencies, and external partners—mirroring real cybersecurity communication requirements.
